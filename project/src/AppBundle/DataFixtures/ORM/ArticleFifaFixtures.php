On June 14, 2009, they are joined by Australia, which is bidding to organize a World Cup in 2018 or 2022. The principle of continental rotation instituted by Sepp Blatter should have led to an organization in North America, as he explained on February 28, 2007 in London during a meeting with officials English: "If the FIFA Executive Committee later decides that the rotation policy is maintained, according to the strict procedure, it will have to be in North America in 2018 and so three countries can organize it, the United States, Mexico and Canada. "FIFA, however, announced the end of the principle. This blog aims to exchange tips and testimonials, so that the road trip in Russia is going well! And you are ready to go, to the east, to attend live matches of our favorite sport !');
